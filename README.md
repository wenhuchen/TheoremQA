# TheoremQA
The dataset and code for paper: TheoremQA: A Theorem-driven Question Answering dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12524). 

## Introduction
We propose the first question-answering dataset driven by STEM theorems. We annotated 800 QA pairs covering 350+ theorems spanning across Math, EE&CS, Physics and Finance. The dataset is collected by human experts with very high quality. We provide the dataset as a new benchmark to test the limit of large language models to apply theorems to solve challenging university-level questions. We provide a pipeline in the following to prompt LLMs and evaluate their outputs with WolframAlpha.

## Files
- theoremqa_test.json: this file contains all the annotated question-answer pairs.
- theoremqa_visual_subset_test.json: this file contains the subset of visual questions if you want to specifically test that.
- all_theorems.json: this file contains the textual description of all the theorems being covered.
- error_analysis/*: this folder contains the error analysis results on the 180-question subset.  
- solutions/*: this folder contains solutions for roughly 180 questions, which correspond to the problems used in error_analysis/
- outputs/\*.json.corrected: this folder contains all the model outputs.

### Chain-of-Thoughts Prompting
```
python run_gpt4.py
```
This will write output to outputs/GPT4_s0...

### Program-of-Thoughts Prompting
```
python run_gpt4_pot.py
```
This will write output to outputs/GPT4_PoT_s0...


### Evaluate model output
You need to register wolfram|alpha account to use their free API, checkout https://products.wolframalpha.com/api to register. Once you are done, you should receive an API_KEY.
```
export OPENAI_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
export WOLFRAM_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
python predict_accuracy.py outputs/[YOUR_FILE]
```
This will write an evaluation output as outputs/[YOUR_FILE].corrected

### Analyze the model output
```
python analyze_results.py outputs/[YOUR_FILE].corrected
```
