Calculate John's maximum daily profit.", "prediction": "$200", "answer": 200, "rationale": "To find John's maximum daily profit, we need to first find his daily revenue function. Since John is a price-taker, his daily revenue function is given by R = P*q, where P is the market price and q is the number of acres John chooses to cut a day.

To find his daily cost function, we need to divide his total cost function by the number of days he works, which we will assume is 1. Therefore, John's daily cost function is C = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50.\n\nNow, we can find John's daily profit function by subtracting his daily cost function from his daily revenue function.

The number of distinct necklaces is equal to the average number of necklaces fixed by each element of the symmetry group. The symmetry group of a necklace with 12 beads is the dihedral group D12, which has 24 elements.\n\nFirst, consider the identity element. There are (10+2) choose 2 = 66 ways to place the two B beads among the 12 beads. Therefore, there are 66 distinct necklaces fixed by the identity element.\n\nNext, consider the 11 rotations. Each rotation is determined by the number of beads that are moved from their original position. There are 11 possible numbers of moved beads: 1, 2, ..., 11. If a rotation moves k beads, then the remaining 12-k beads must be in the same relative order as in the original necklace. There are (10 choose k)(2 choose 0) = (10 choose k) ways to choose the k beads that are moved. Therefore, the number of necklaces fixed by a rotation of k beads is (10 choose k).\n\nFinally, consider the 12 reflections. Each reflection is determined by the axis of symmetry, which can be either a line passing through two opposite beads or a line passing through the midpoint of two opposite edges. If a reflection is along a line passing through two opposite beads, then the two B beads must be on opposite sides of the line. There are 5 such lines, and for each line there are (10 choose 1)(2 choose 1) = 20 ways to place the two B beads. Therefore, the number of necklaces fixed by a reflection along such a line is 20.

To exclude these arrangements, we can choose one of the 5 tables to be empty in ${5\\choose1}$ ways, and then seat the remaining 7 people at the remaining 4 tables in ${4\\choose3}$ ways (using stars and bars again). This gives a total of ${5\\choose1}{4\\choose3} = 20$ arrangements where at least one table is empty.\n\nBut we have overcounted arrangements where two or more tables are empty. To correct for this, we can use PIE. The number of arrangements where two tables are empty can be calculated in ${5\\choose2}$ ways, and then seat the remaining 7 people at the remaining 3 tables in ${3\\choose1}$ ways. Similarly, the number of arrangements where three tables are empty is ${5\\choose3}{2\\choose1}$, and the number of arrangements where four tables are empty is ${5\\choose4}{1\\choose1}$. However, we cannot have all five tables empty since each table must have at least one person seated.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements where at least one table has at least one person seated is:\n\n${6\\choose4} - {5\\choose1}{4\\choose3} + {5\\choose2}{3\\choose1} - {5\\choose3}{2\\choose1} + {5\\choose4}{1\\choose1} - 1 = 15 - 20 + 15 - 10 + 5 - 1 = 4$\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.", "answer_type": "integer"}

It is noted that the segments do experience a store-and-forward delay in intermediate routers. Determine how many ms client A takes to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request.", "prediction": "9600 ms", "answer": 918, "rationale": "First, we need to calculate the effective bandwidth between the server and the client. Since there are 2 intermediate nodes, the total bandwidth is the product of the bandwidths of the 3 links, which is 10 Mbps * 10 Mbps * 10 Mbps = 10 Gbps. However, we need to take into account the store-and-forward delay in the intermediate nodes. Each intermediate node will introduce a delay of 2 * RTT = 60 ms (since the segment size is 15 Kbytes and the transmission rate is 10 Mbps, it takes 12 ms to transmit each segment). Therefore, the effective bandwidth is:\n\nEffective bandwidth = Segment size / (RTT + Store-and-forward delay)\n                   = 15 Kbytes / (30 ms + 60 ms + 60 ms)\n                   = 100 Kbps\n\nNext, we need to calculate the congestion window (cwnd) at the start of the transmission. Since the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the initial cwnd is:\n\ncwnd = Initial slow-start threshold * Segment size\n     = 8 * 15 Kbytes\n     = 120 Kbytes\n\nSince the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 Kbytes, the maximum cwnd that can be achieved without causing buffer overflow is 150 Kbytes. Therefore, the congestion window will increase from 120 Kbytes to 150 Kbytes during the slow-start phase.\n\nAfter the slow-start phase, the congestion window will increase according to the congestion avoidance algorithm of TCP Reno. Since there is no loss during transmission, the congestion window will increase linearly by 1 segment per RTT. Therefore, the time taken to transmit the whole file can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime taken = (File size + Slow-start phase + Congestion avoidance phase) / Effective bandwidth\n\nwhere File size = 900 Kbytes, Slow-start phase = 2 * RTT, and Congestion avoidance phase = (File size - Slow-start phase) / cwnd * RTT.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nTime taken = (900 Kbytes + 2 * 30 ms + (900 Kbytes - 2 * 30 ms) / 120 Kbytes * 30 ms) / 100 Kbps\n           = 9.6 s\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9600 ms.", "answer_type": "integer"}

In base 2, the sum of the digits is equal to the number of 1's in the binary representation. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers between 1 and 2^40 that contain two 1's in their binary representation and have a sum of digits that is divisible by 9.\n\nLet N be the number of such integers. We can count N by considering the number of ways to choose the positions of the two 1's in the binary representation. There are 40 choose 2 ways to do this, which is equal to 780. However, we need to exclude the numbers that have leading zeros, since they are not between 1 and 2^40. There are 38 choose 1 ways to choose the position of the leftmost 1, and for each such choice, there are 36 choose 1 ways to choose the position of the other 1.

We want to find the area of the part of the helicoid that lies in the first octant between the cylinders $x^2+y^2=1$ and $x^2+y^2=4$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the limits of integration for $u$ and $v$.

Since the distance between Earth and Sun is 8.3 light-minutes, it takes 8.3 minutes for light to travel from one to the other. Therefore, event B occurs 8.3 - 2 = 6.3 minutes after event A.\n\nNow, let's consider an observer moving at u = 0.8c from Earth to Sun. According to special relativity, time dilation occurs for moving observers, which means that time appears to pass slower for them compared to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame. The time dilation factor for this observer can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u/c)^2)\n\nwhere u is the velocity of the observer and c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2) = 1.67\n\nThis means that time appears to pass 1.67 times slower for the moving observer compared to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame.

What is the price of this bond?", "prediction": "approximately $1,079.64", "answer": 91.17, "rationale": "We can use the formula for the present value of a bond to find its price. Let P be the price of the bond, C be the coupon payment, r be the yield, n be the number of periods, and F be the face value of the bond. Then, we have:\n\nP = (C/r) x [1 - 1/(1+r)^n] + F/(1+r)^n\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nP = (0.08 x F/2) x [1 - 1/(1+0.09/2)^(2x18)] + F/(1+0.09/2)^(2x18)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nP = 40 x [1 - 1/1.09^36] + 1000/1.09^36\n\nTherefore, the price of the bond is approximately $1,079.64.", "answer_type": "float"}
{"id": "xueguangma/zscore.json", "question": "If the annual earnings per share has mean $8.6 and standard deviation $3.4, what is the chance that an observed EPS less than $5.5?", "prediction": "approximately 0.1814 or 18.14%", "answer": 0.1814, "rationale": "We can use the standard normal distribution to answer this question. First, we need to standardize the observed EPS value of $5.5 using the formula:\n\nz = (x - mu) / sigma\n\nwhere x is the observed EPS value, mu is the mean EPS value, and sigma is the standard deviation of EPS. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nz = (5.5 - 8.6) / 3.4 = -0.912\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of a standard normal variable being less than -0.912. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find this probability to be approximately 0.1814.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: the chance that an observed EPS less than $5.5 is approximately 0.1814 or 18.14%.", "answer_type": "float"}
