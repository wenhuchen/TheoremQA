Since P(umbrella | rain) is higher, it is more likely that it rained on day 1. So we can say day 1 was likely rain.\n\n2) On day 2, the person did not bring an umbrella. Again, looking at the conditional probabilities, not bringing an umbrella is more likely when it is sunny. So day 2 was likely sunny.  \n\n3) On day 3, the person brought an umbrella again.

So we first need to count the number of rooted trees on 6 vertices.\nStep 2: By Cayley's formula, the number of rooted trees on n vertices is n^(n-2). Therefore, the number of rooted trees on 6 vertices is 6^4 = 1296.\nStep 3: Now we need to count the number of ways to partition 6 vertices into disjoint subsets and form rooted trees from each subset. This is the same as counting the number of compositions of 6. \nStep 4: The number of compositions of n into k parts is (n-1 choose k-1). Therefore, the number of compositions of 6 into 2 to 6 parts is:\n(6-1 choose 1) + (6-1 choose 2) + (6-1 choose 3) + (6-1 choose 4) + (6-1 choose 5)  \n      = 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 31\nStep 5: For each composition, we can form rooted trees on the corresponding number of vertices. By step 2, there are 1296 ways to form a rooted tree on 2 vertices, 1296 ways for 3 vertices, etc.\nStep 6: Therefore, by the product rule, the total number of labelled rooted forests on 6 vertices is 1296*1296*1296*1296*1296 = 1296^5, which is approximately 1.6 x 10^15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.6 x 10^15 labelled rooted forests on 6 vertices.",

Since it is a DC input, the output of the integrator will be a linearly increasing voltage. \n3. The quantizer has only 2 levels, 0 v and 1 v. So the output will switch between 0 v and 1 v as the integrator output crosses the threshold voltages of the quantizer.\n4.

    "question": "A bungee cord is 30.0 m long and, when stretched a distance x, it exerts a restoring force of magnitude kx. Your father-in-law (mass 95.0 kg) stands on a platform 45.0 m above the ground, and one end of the cord is tied securely to his ankle and the other end to the platform. You have promised him that when he steps off the platform he will fall a maximum distance of only 41.0 m before the cord stops him. You had several bungee cords to select from, and you tested them by stretching them out, tying one end to a tree, and pulling on the other end with a force of 380.0 N. When you do this, what distance (in m) will the bungee cord that you should select have stretched?",
    "answer": 0.602,
    "rationale": " Step by step solution:\n1) We are given that the bungee cord exhibits Hooke's law behavior, with a restoring force proportional to the stretch distance: F = kx\n2) We want the cord to stretch a maximum of 41.0 m when the 95.0 kg father-in-law jumps. \n3) From Newton's second law, the force exerted by the cord is equal to the mass times acceleration: F = ma\n4) The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, so the force exerted by the cord when the father-in-law is at the maximum stretch of 41.0 m is:\nF = (95.0 kg)(9.8 m/s^2) = 930 N\n5) We tested the cords by pulling on one end with a force of 380 N. The distance this force stretched the cord will be in the same proportion to 41.0 m as 380 N is to 930 N. Using proportionality:\nx/41.0 m = 380 N/ 930 N\n6) Solving for x gives:\nx = (380 N / 930 N) * 41.0 m \nx = 14.2 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the bungee cord you should select stretched 14.2 m when you pulled on it with a force of 380 N.",

    "answer": 19,
    "rationale": " Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. We are given that the half-life of radium is 80 years. This means the decay time of radium atoms has an exponential distribution with a mean (and median) of 80 years.\n\n2. We want to describe the decay time to 3 digit accuracy, so our precision is 0.1 years. This means the possible values of decay time range from 0 to 1000 years with a precision of 0.1 years.  \n\n3. Since the possible values range from 0 to 1000 years with a precision of 0.1 years, there are 10000 possible values.  \n\n4. Each possible value requires log2(10000) = 14 bits to represent.  \n\n5. On average, we need 14 bits to represent a single decay time to the given precision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that roughly 14 bits are required on the average to describe to 3 digit accuracy the decay time (in years) of a radium atom if the half-life of radium is 80 years.",

There are (n-1)! ways to label an n-vertex tree. Since we have 5 components of sizes 1,1,1,1 and 3, the number of ways to label the trees within components is (1-1)! * (1-1)! * (1-1)! * (1-1)! * (3-1)! = 1*1*1*1*2 = 2\nStep 6: By the multiplication principle, the total number of labelled forests is 10 * 2 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20.",

Multiplying the cross section, 0.68 barn = 6.8 x 10^-24 cm2, by the area density gives:\n     (0.68 barn) x (8.08 x 10^22 atoms/cm2) = 5.5 x 10-2\n7.

We can calculate this from the density of silver, \u03c1 = 10.5 g/cm3\nn = \u03c1NA/A  where NA is Avogadro's number and A is the molar mass of silver\nn = (10.5 g/cm3)(6.022x1023 atoms/mol)/(107.87 g/mol) = 5.06 x 1022 atoms/cm3\n6) The volume of the silver layer is area x thickness = (1 cm2)(0.002 cm) = 2 x 10-4 cm3\n7) The number of silver atoms in the layer is n x volume = (5.06 x 1022 atoms/cm3)(2 x 10-4 cm3) = 1.01 x 1019 atoms\n8) The probability of capture for one neutron passing one silver atom is the cross section (17 barns) divided by the total cross sectional area of all the silver atoms.  \nSince 1 barn = 10-24 cm2 and the cross sectional area of one silver atom is \u03c0r2 where r is the atomic radius of silver (0.159 nm), the probability of capture per atom is  \n17 x 10-24 cm2 / (\u03c0(0.159nm)2) = 1.7 x 10-3\n\n9) Therefore, the total probability of capture for the neutron passing through the layer is approximately the number of atoms times the probability per atom:\n(1.01 x 1019 atoms)(1.7 x 10-3) = 0.172  \nTherefore, the answer is that the probability of the neutron being captured is approximately 0.172 or 17.2%.",

    "answer": 0.99996,
    "rationale": " Step by step:\n1) We are given that the energy of each gold ion is 100 GeV per nucleon. A gold ion has 79 protons and 118 neutrons, so total nucleons is 197. Therefore total energy of each gold ion is 100 GeV/nucleon * 197 nucleons = 19,700 GeV. \n2) According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E = mc^2, we can find the relativistic mass of the gold ion as m = E/c^2 = 19,700 GeV/(3x10^8 m/s)^2 = 1.3 x 10^-22 kg.\n3) The kinetic energy of the gold ion is K = (\u03b3-1)mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. Since the gold ions are moving at relativistic speeds, we can assume the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy, K \u2248 E = 19,700 GeV.\n4) Substituting this into the kinetic energy formula and rearranging, we get:\n \u03b3 = 1 + K/(mc^2) = 1 + 19,700 GeV/(1.3 x 10^-22 kg x (3x10^8 m/s)^2)\n5) Solving this gives \u03b3 \u2248 1.5 x 10^4\n6) The speed of the gold ions, v, is related to the Lorentz factor by \u03b3 = 1/(1-(v/c)^2)^(1/2)\n7) Solving for v/c gives v/c = (1 - 1/\u03b3^2)^(1/2) = 0.999946\n\nTherefore, the answer is: the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light is 0.999946.",

    "answer": 108000,
    "rationale": " Step 1) We are given that each engine develops a thrust of 322,000 N. Thrust is a force.\n\nStep 2) We are told the airplane is flying at 250 m/s. This is the velocity of the airplane.\n\nStep 3) We want to find the horsepower of each engine. Horsepower is a unit of power, which is force times velocity. \n\nStep 4) We can calculate the power in watts of each engine using the formula:\n     Power (watts) = Force (newtons) x Velocity (m/s)\n     So, for 1 engine:\n     P = 322,000 N x 250 m/s = 80,500,000 watts\n\nStep 5) We need to convert this to horsepower. 1 horsepower is equal to 746 watts. So we divide the power in watts by 746.\n   80,500,000 watts / 746 watts per horsepower = 107,800 horsepower\n\nTherefore, the answer is that each engine develops 107,800 horsepower.",

    "question": "At a waterpark, sleds with riders are sent along a slippery, horizontal surface by the release of a large compressed spring. The spring with force constant k = 40.0 N/cm and negligible mass rests on the frictionless horizontal surface. One end is in contact with a stationary wall. A sled and rider with total mass 70.0 kg are pushed against the other end, compressing the spring 0.375 m. The sled is then released with zero initial velocity. What is the sled's speed (in m/s) when the spring returns to its uncompressed length?",

    "rationale": " Step 1: Since $0 < a_n < 1$ for all $n$, the sequence $a_n$ is bounded above by 1 and bounded below by 0.\n\nStep 2: The condition $(1-a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4$ implies that $a_{n+1} > (1/4)/(1-a_n)$.  Since $a_n$ is bounded away from 1, the denominator $1-a_n$ is bounded away from 0.  Therefore $a_{n+1}$ must be bounded away from 0.\n\nStep 3: Combining steps 1 and 2, we have that the sequence $a_n$ is bounded and bounded away from 0.  By the monotone convergence theorem, this implies $a_n$ converges to some limit $L$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nStep 4: Taking the limit as $n$ approaches infinity on both sides of the inequality $(1-a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4$, we have $(1-L)L \\geq 1/4$.

    "answer": 330.76,
    "rationale": " Step by step calculation:\n\n1. The speed of the shuttle is given as 7712 m/s. We need to convert this to a more convenient unit, so we divide by the speed of light (c = 299792458 m/s) to get the speed as a fraction of c. 7712/299792458 = 0.000257c.\n\n2. According to special relativity, the time dilation factor is given by 1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2) where v is the speed. Plugging in 0.000257 for v/c, we get 1/sqrt(1-(0.000257)^2) = 0.999999843, meaning time runs 0.999999843 times as fast on the shuttle.\n\n3. For each second that passes on Earth, 0.999999843 seconds pass on the shuttle. So for each second on Earth, the shuttle clock loses (1 - 0.999999843) = 0.000000157 seconds. \n\n4.

The film is illuminated without knowledge of the position of the silver iodide particles. It is then developed and the receiver sees only the silver iodide particles that have been illuminated. It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. Silver iodide particles that are not illuminated and vacant portions of the film remain blank. We make the following assumptions: We grid the film very finely into cells of area $dA$. It is assumed that there is at most one silver iodide particle per cell and that no silver iodide particle is intersected by the cell boundaries. Thus, the film can be considered to be a large number of parallel binary asymmetric channels with crossover probability $1 - 100dA$. What is the capacity of a 0.1 unit area film?",
