Let's set up the budget constraint equation:\n\n0.10t + 0.25s = 1\n\nNow, we need to solve for either t or s to substitute into the utility function. Let's solve for s:\n\ns = (1 - 0.10t) / 0.25\n\nNow, substitute this expression for s into the utility function:\n\nU(t, s) = \u221a(t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))\n\nTo maximize utility, we need to find the maximum value of this function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the utility function with respect to t and set it equal to 0:\n\ndU(t)/dt = (1/2) * (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) * (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0 and solving for t:\n\n0 = (1/2) * (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) * (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSince the term (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) cannot be 0, we can ignore it and focus on the remaining part of the equation:\n\n0 = (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (1/0.25) / 0.20 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nSince Paul can only buy whole Twinkies, he should buy either 2 or 3 Twinkies.

Also, the number of questions answered by any two students in different classes is different, so we can assume that a < b < c < d < e.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who only answered one question, we need to minimize the number of questions answered by students in other classes. Let's start with the minimum values for a, b, c, d, and e:\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = 3\nd = 4\ne = 5\n\nNow we need to find the number of students in each class (A, B, C, D, and E) that satisfies the given conditions. We can start by assigning the maximum number of students to class A:\n\nA = 30 - (B + C + D + E)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the total number of questions:\n\n(30 - (B + C + D + E)) * 1 + B * 2 + C * 3 + D * 4 + E * 5 = 40\n\nSimplifying:\n\n30 - B - C - D - E + 2B + 3C + 4D + 5E = 40\n\nB + 2C + 3D + 4E = 10\n\nNow we need to find the values of B, C, D, and E that satisfy this equation.

Let's denote the area of triangle ABC as S.

We want to find the probability that none of these points lie inside the triangle formed by the other three. This is equivalent to finding the probability that P1 is not inside the triangle P2P3P4, P2 is not inside the triangle P1P3P4, P3 is not inside the triangle P1P2P4, and P4 is not inside the triangle P1P2P3.\n\nLet's consider the case where P1 is not inside the triangle P2P3P4. This means that P1 must lie inside the triangle formed by the vertices A, B, and C, but outside the triangle P2P3P4. The area of the triangle P2P3P4 is S - S(P1), where S(P1) is the area of the triangle formed by P1 and the vertices A, B, and C.

The speed of sound at 8000 m altitude is approximately 295 m/s. Since the airplane is flying at Mach 1.75, its speed is 1.75 times the speed of sound:\n\nSpeed of airplane = Mach number \u00d7 Speed of sound\nSpeed of airplane = 1.75 \u00d7 295 m/s\nSpeed of airplane = 516.25 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the distance the sonic boom travels before reaching the observer. Since the airplane is flying at an altitude of 8000 m, the distance the sonic boom travels is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the altitude and the other leg being the horizontal distance the airplane travels while the sonic boom reaches the ground.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal distance as x.

Let v be the number of vertices, e be the number of edges, and f be the number of faces. According to Euler's formula for convex polyhedra, we have:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nSince there are k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces, the total number of faces is:\n\nf = k + m\n\nEach pentagonal face has 5 edges, and each hexagonal face has 6 edges.

Each vertex is shared by three faces in a convex polyhedron with only pentagonal and hexagonal faces. Therefore, we have:\n\nv = (5k + 6m) / 3\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for v, e, and f into Euler's formula:\n\n(5k + 6m) / 3 - (5k + 6m) / 2 + k + m = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions, we get:\n\n2(5k + 6m) - 3(5k + 6m) + 6k + 6m = 12\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n-5k + 6m = 12\n\nSince k and m are both integers, we can find the possible values of k by trying different values of m and checking if the resulting k is an integer.

Therefore, the total number of integers in set S is (40 * 39) / 2 = 780.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of integers in S that are divisible by 9. Since 2^x + 2^y is divisible by 9, we have 2^x \u2261 -2^y (mod 9). We can rewrite this as 2^x \u2261 2^(y+3) (mod 9), since 2^3 \u2261 -1 (mod 9). \n\nWe can now create a table of powers of 2 modulo 9:\n\n2^0 \u2261 1 (mod 9)\n2^1 \u2261 2 (mod 9)\n2^2 \u2261 4 (mod 9)\n2^3 \u2261 8 \u2261 -1 (mod 9)\n2^4 \u2261 7 (mod 9)\n2^5 \u2261 5 (mod 9)\n2^6 \u2261 1 (mod 9)\n\nThe powers of 2 modulo 9 repeat with a period of 6. Therefore, we only need to consider the exponents x and y modulo 6. We have the following possibilities for (x, y) modulo 6: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (4, 1), and (5, 2). Each of these pairs corresponds to a unique solution modulo 6, and since 40 is a multiple of 6, each pair corresponds to exactly one solution in the range 0 \u2264 x, y < 40.\n\nThus, there are 6 integers in S that are divisible by 9. The probability that a random integer from S is divisible by 9 is 6/780, which simplifies to 1/130.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/130.", "answer_type": "float"}

We can do this by finding the Laurent series expansion of our function around $z = 0$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2i}(z^2 e^{i/z} - z^2 e^{-i/z}) = \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(z^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(i/z)^n}{n!} - z^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-i/z)^n}{n!}\\right)$$\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(z^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{i^n}{n! z^n} - z^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-i)^n}{n! z^n}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can see that the only term that has a singularity at $z = 0$ is the term with $n = 1$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2i}\\left(z^2 \\frac{i}{z} - z^2 \\frac{-i}{z}\\right) + \\text{analytic terms}$$\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2i}(zi - (-zi)) + \\text{analytic terms}$$\n\n$$f(z) = zi + \\text{analytic terms}$$\n\nNow, we can see that the function $g(z) = zi$ has the same derivative as our function at $z = 0$ and is analytic inside and on the contour $|z| = 1$. Therefore, we can use the Cauchy integral formula to compute the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_{|z| = 1} z^2 \\sin(1/z) dz = \\oint_{|z| = 1} zi dz$$\n\nSince $g(z) = zi$ is analytic inside and on the contour $|z| = 1$, its integral over the contour is zero:\n\n$$\\oint_{|z| = 1} zi dz = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.", "answer_type": "float"}

The time taken by a lavender caterpillar to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar is 10 seconds, so the speed ratio is L/10 = V/L, which gives L^2 = 10V.\n5. Violet and mauve caterpillars both crawl twice as fast as lavender caterpillars, so V/L = M/L, which gives M = V.\n\nNow, we can solve these equations step by step:\n\nFrom equation 4, we have L^2 = 10V. Since M = V, we can write L^2 = 10M.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have M = 7V/5. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get L^2 = 10(7V/5), which gives L^2 = 14V.\n\nFrom equation 2, we have M = 8V - 3L. Substituting M = V, we get V = 8V - 3L, which gives 7V = 3L.

Standard Brownian motion, also known as Wiener process, is a continuous-time stochastic process with the following properties:\n\n1. W(0) = 0.\n2. The increments are independent, i.e., for any 0 \u2264 s < t, the increment W(t) - W(s) is independent of the past {W(u) : 0 \u2264 u \u2264 s}.\n3. The increments are normally distributed, i.e., for any 0 \u2264 s < t, the increment W(t) - W(s) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t - s.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given expression W(1) + W(2). Since the increments are independent, we can write W(2) as W(2) - W(1) + W(1). Therefore, the expression becomes W(1) + (W(2) - W(1)).\n\nW(1) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, and W(2) - W(1) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2 - 1 = 1. Since the increments are independent, the sum of two independent normal distributions is also a normal distribution with the mean being the sum of the means and the variance being the sum of the variances.\n\nThus, W(1) + (W(2) - W(1)) is normally distributed with mean 0 + 0 = 0 and variance 1 + 1 = 2. To find the probability P(W(1) + W(2) > 2), we need to find the probability that a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 is greater than 2.\n\nWe can standardize the normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (which is the square root of the variance).
